xmas, this it a mod for minetest/freeminer/minetime that grows a decorated 24 node (72m) 
tree, it is perfect for that holiday theme!  

Balls are set to mesh but as a fallback they will be shown as wool nodes only if
your version isnt compatiably wiht mesh nodes!

to remove tree just dig the trunk, all balls and leaves are set up foe leafdecay.
Note thet due to the size leafdecay will lag the game/server a bit till it is all
gone away. also the star drops you your xmas sapling back for the next tree!
